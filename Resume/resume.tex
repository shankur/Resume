% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the

\section{Projects}
\runsubsection{chainifyDB}
\descript{Transform DB into Blockchain System}
\location{Jan 2019 – Present | Published at CIDR'2021 | Project Leader}
Designed and developed the distributed architecture of \href{www.chainifydb.com}{chainifyDB} that allows us to transform a set of existing databases into a 
blockchain system ensuring zero down-time, e2e encryption, and only 17\% overhead on the underlying database system.\\
\texttt{Tech-Stack}: Go | Docker | Kubernetes | gRPC | protobuf | Kafka | SQL | Git | CI/CD

\sectionsep

\runsubsection{Fabric++}
\descript{Optimizing Permissioned-Blockchain Systems}
\location{Jan 2018 – Oct 2018 | Published at SIGMOD'2019}
Integrated MVCC with early aborts and transaction-reordering into Hyperledger Fabric to improve the transactional throughput by up to 12x for contended workloads.\\
\texttt{Tech-Stack}: Go | C++ | Bash | NodeJS | Docker | gRPC | protobuf | Kafka | Git

\sectionsep

\runsubsection{AnKerDB}
\descript{Hybrid OLTP/OLAP Processing}
\location{Apr 2016 – Dec 2017 | Published at PVLDB'2016 and SIGMOD'2018}
Extended Linux-kernel to support virtual memory snapshotting. Developed a prototype main-memory DBMS to exploit snapshotting and reduce the scanning-overhead in MVCC due to random accesses, bringing down the latency by 4x.\\
